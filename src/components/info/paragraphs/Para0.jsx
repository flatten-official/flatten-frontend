      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause
      respiratory illness in people, ranging from mild common colds to severe
      cases of pneumonia, while others cause illness in animals only. Novel
      coronaviruses are new strains of the virus that have not been previously
      identified in humans.
