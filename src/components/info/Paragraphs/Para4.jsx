      If you are seeking help for mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms, you can
      contact Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000, your local public health
      unit, or your primary care provider, but know that there are no treatments
      at this time and you will be instructed to stay home and practice methods
      of social distancing (described below). Do not visit an assessment centre
      unless you have been referred by a healthcare professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are seriously ill or experiencing severe symptoms (severe shortness
      of breath, chest pain, serious weakness or lethargy that impairs the
      ability to carry out your regular activities) call your healthcare
      provider for medical advice. If you have a medical emergency and need to
      call 911, notify the operator that you have or think you might have,
      COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before medical help arrives.
