      Symptoms for COVID-19 are similar to those for influenza or other
      respiratory illnesses. The most common symptoms include: fever, cough, and
      shortness of breath. Less common symptoms can include extreme tiredness,
      sore throat, and runny nose
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people (about 80%) recover from this disease without needing special
      treatment, but it can also cause serious illness. Those who are older and
      those with other medical problems are more likely to develop serious
      illness, which can include difficulty breathing and pneumonia; there is
      also a risk of death in severe cases
    </p>
    <p>
      While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older
      persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high
      blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, active cancer, dialysis, or
      diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others
