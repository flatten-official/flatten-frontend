      Social distancing is used to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the
      community. This means minimizing close contact with others during the peak
      of an outbreak. Where possible, we would encourage you to: avoid public
      transit, stay 6 feet away from others, reduce your exposure in the
      community by avoiding areas such as shopping malls, recreation centers,
      movie theatres, and avoid social gatherings. Overall, try to limit your
      exposure outside the home.
